We have published our Environmental Impact Report 2021, which documents Scott Logic’s carbon footprint in 2021, describes what we are currently doing to significantly reduce our ongoing environmental impact, and sets out our roadmap to net zero.

This is the result of work we commenced last year with Avieco, experts in helping and empowering organisations to become more sustainable. With their support and guidance, we calculated our Greenhouse Gas emissions in accordance with the requirements of the World Resources Institute (WRI) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol (revised version), aligning with the expectations of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

2021 Carbon Footprint
In the calendar year 2021, our GHG emissions from all business-related activities totalled 1,519 tCO2e (tonnes of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent is a standardised unit for measuring GHG emissions, regardless of which gas the emission refers to). You can download the report below to read a breakdown of the sources that contributed to that total.

Our road to net zero
At Scott Logic, we are committed to creating sustainable prosperity and safeguarding the future of the natural environment. To live up to that commitment, we aspire not only to mitigate the risk of rising emissions from our own fast-growing business, but also to demonstrate climate leadership amongst our peers, industry and clients by going beyond minimum requirements.

We are aligning with international best practice set out by the SBTi in attempting to achieve net zero by no later than 2050, in accordance with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels. 

However, our ambition is stronger: we’re aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2028 and net zero by 2040.

To achieve this, we are focusing both on how we run our business and how we contribute to wider climate action. Both will require technical ingenuity and innovation to ensure that the growth of greenhouse gas emissions is decoupled from business growth.

In the spirit of collective action, we are an active member of Tech Zero, a UN Race To Zero partner climate action group, and are committing to validated Science Based Targets. We will continue to work with our clients, suppliers, employees, neighbours and local communities to share best practice and help each other safeguard the future of the natural environment.

We believe in holding ourselves publicly accountable for the progress we make towards this ambitious goal. That’s why we will publish an Environmental Impact Report annually from now on.
